Welcome to Stars

Started by seeding restaurant data in a few cities. Users can signup, login, and demo the website as a guest.
We can begin by filtering our index by location and dive deeper looking at each individual show page.
From there, logged in users can post reviews that dynamically update ratings for a particular restaurant.
